## h5bp documentation generator

A static site generator written in node. It's lyke Jehyll but somewhat simpler and more focused. takes a src folder, runs it through Markdown and generates for each markdown file (.md, .mkd, .markdown) a complete, static website.

The main purpose of this tiny utility is to work nicely with github wikis (gollum). Running it through this program will generate a static website suitable for serving with Apache or any other web server.

### Quick start

  git clone thisrepo
  cd repo
  npm link
  
npm link will install dependencies defined in package.json and create a globally-installed symbolic link from package-name (h5bp-docs for now) to the current folder.

### Usage

    $ h5bp-docs [options]

    options:
      --verbose         Enable verbose output
      --server          Start a static connect server once generation done
      --src             Source folder where markdown files to process are stored
      --assets          assets that get copied in the public folder of dest/
      --dest            Destination folder, place where the generated files will land
      --layout          layout file used to generate each files, using {{{ content }}} placeholder
      -h, --help        You're staring at it
      
_example_

    mkdir test-docs
    cd test-docs
    git clone git://github.com/user/project.wiki.git wikis/project
    h5bp-docs --src wiki/project --dest docs --verbose
    
append --server flag to start a static server (using connect) that serves the generated files.
  

### Configuration

The following is a list of the currently supported configuration options. These can all be specified by creating a config.yml (now a bacic commonjs module) file in the siteâ€™s root directory. There are also flags for the h5bp executable which are described below next to their respective configuration options. The order of precedence for conflicting settings is:

* Command-line flags
* Configuration file settings (config.yml)
* Defaults (conf/config.js)
